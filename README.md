Awesome stuff to do in Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.

This is a heavily opinionated list of places to go while in Porto Alegre. Pull request are welcome.

## eat

### barbecue

Porto Alegre is one of the barbecue capitals of the world. The now classic *churrascaria* model was born here and exported to countless places.

* **Costela no Rolete** ($$$): Not a traditional churrascaria, both in meat selection (this place focuses exclusively on ribs) as well as in brabecuing technique (the skewers of Southern Brazilan barbecue tradition are not used), but still a must go for meat lovers.
* **Na Brasa** ($$$$$)
* **Grelhattu's** ($$$)
* **Parrilla del Sur** ($$$$)

### xis

The word xis (literally the name of the letter 'X' in Portuguese) is a phonetical translation of "cheese" and was used to describe cheese burgers. In the same way the word was switched over time, so was the approach to preparing these. If you are looking for traditional American burgers, look at the section below. This section is about xis. And you should absolutely try them.

* **Speed Lanches** ($$)
* **Tia Zefa** ($$)
* **Cavanhas** ($$)
* **Papa Léguas** ($$)
* **Bauro do Trianon** ($$)

### burgers

* **Bife** ($$$)
* **20/9** (pronounced "vinte barra nove") ($$$)

### vegetarian and vegan
* **B Burger** ($$$)
* **Ocidente** ($$$)

### Italian

* **Atelier de massas** ($$$)
* **Peppo Cuccina** ($$$$)

### misc

* **Lancheria do Parque** ($$)

### on a budget

* **Tudo pelo Social** ($$): Bring friends, lots of them, as the portions are big. And tasty. And pretty decent in price.
* **Rossi Grelhados** ($$): focus is on meat (noticing a trend here? It's not me, it's this carnivorous city!), at a pretty decent price you can get a great steak, with fries and/or salad as a side.

### splurge
* ** Koh Pee Pee** ($$$$$)
* ** Hashi ** ($$$$$)
* ** Floriano Spiess ** ($$$$$)

## drinks

* Lagom Brewpub ($$$)
* Bier Markt ($$$)
* Malt Store ($$$)
* Mulligan ($$$)
* Dirty Old Man ($$$)

## culture

* Usina do Gasômetro
* Casa de Cultura Mário Quintana
* MARGS
* Santander Cultural

## party

I'm a nerd with two small kids. Any advice here would be outdated, so PRs are more than welcome.
